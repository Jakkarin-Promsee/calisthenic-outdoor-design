## Overview

A complete design-and-research package for a permanent **outdoor calisthenics gym** in a private back garden, built for an adult plus a young child (~5 years): four welded-steel training structures and an impact-absorbing rubber floor, with 3D models built in Blender and a full set of formal documents (design, load analysis, verification, foundations, sourcing research, and handover/liability paperwork).

## Engineering basis

> A preliminary, first-order assessment intended for the certifying engineer to review and verify — not a final structural calculation.

- **Design load** — EN 16630:2015 Table 1: **1,942 N per user station** (dynamic factor C_dyn = 2.0 already included); two simultaneous users = 2,722 N.
- **Verdict** — under the standard load and specified walls (3.2 mm), **all members pass the preliminary first-order check — none yield.** The primary structure (posts, foundations, anchors) sits at low utilisation (≈ 0.2–0.5).
- **6 watch points** flagged for the certifying engineer: (1) the monkey-bar **triangle brace** at Zone 4 — the 2.70 m post only passes because of it; (2) the pull-up high bar (OD 34, 1.5 m — moderate margin); (3) the snake side-grip and dip-nub cantilevers; (4) dip-frame lateral stability; (5) weld quality at dynamic load points; (6) fall-safety rubber thickness.
- **Foundations** — 9 mm welded base plates + **M12×120 hot-dip-galvanised wedge anchors** into a C20/25 concrete slab ≥ 140 mm thick (21 plates · 72 anchors).
- **Assembly** — sub-assemblies are **shop-welded → hot-dip galvanised as whole pieces → field-bolted** on site through end plates, keeping the coating intact; every sealed hollow section gets a **vent hole** before galvanising.

## Status and responsibility

> [!WARNING]
> These documents do not authorise construction. The licensed engineer (**Party C**) must review, calculate, certify, and physically inspect — welds, foundations, and anchors — **before opening for use, and especially before any child uses the equipment.**

- All documents are **preliminary functional design + research**, compiled from public sources and delivered **as-is, with no warranty** — they are **not** certified engineering calculations.
- The project is organised around **four roles**:

| Role  | Party                                 | Responsibility                                      |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **A** | Researcher                            | Compiles the design and data                        |
| **B** | Coordinator                           | Proposes the design to the owner                    |
| **C** | Owner / Licensed Engineer / Inspector | Reviews, certifies, approves, and hires the builder |
| **D** | Contractor                            | Builds to the approved design                       |
